## General info
This project is a Windows Forms Application.  
The main purpose is to defeat all the enemies on all seven levels.  
It's a turn-based system - you make one move (move or attack) and then the enemy gets a chance to move and attack.  
You and your enemies have hit points which go down after the attack. Once the hit points get down to zero, the character dies.  
There are weapons and potions scattered around the dungeon that you can pick up and use to defeat enemies.
